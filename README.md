# The Third Research Edition Unix Programmer's Manual

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/111328229.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/111328229)

This repository maintains the tools for formatting and
making available the *Unix Programmer's Manual*
(Third Edition, February 1973).
The generated formatted manual is made available
[in PDF form](https://dspinellis.github.io/unix-v3man/v3man.pdf).

The manual pages and tools are derived from 1973 material unearthed
by [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie), and
[made available](http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/Dennis_v3/)
through the [The Unix Heritage Society](http://www.tuhs.org/).
This is the last edition of the manual that was created
in [nroff (line-printed) form](http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/Dennis_v3/Readme.v3man) (rather than typeset with *troff*).
I corrected some minor markup
glitches through commits that are recorded in this repository.
You can find the evolution of the manual pages recorded in the
[Unix history repository](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo).
Furthermore, you can find the evolution of the corresponding facilities
on a series of tables available
[here](https://dspinellis.github.io/unix-history-man/index.html).
